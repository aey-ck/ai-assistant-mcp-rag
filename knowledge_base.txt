Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System.
The two moons of Mars are Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. There have been numerous uncrewed spacecraft missions to Mars. The first successful flyby was Mariner 4 in 1965. The first successful landing was by the Mars 3 probe in 1971, although contact was lost shortly after. As of 2024, there are two active rovers on the surface, Curiosity and Perseverance, and one lander, InSight. Water ice has been confirmed to exist on the planet's surface and subsurface. The Perseverance rover discovered that the Jezero crater was once a lake, confirming the presence of ancient liquid water.
